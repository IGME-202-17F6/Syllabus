## Course Description

In this course, students will learn to create visually rich interactive experiences. It is a course in programming graphics and media, but it is also a course on the relationship between ideas and code. Students will explore topics in math and physics by building programs that simulate and visualize processes in the natural world. Assignments will include major programming projects, such as building a virtual world inhabited by digital creatures that display observable behaviors.

### Prerequisites

* **or** IGME-106 Game Development and Algorithmic Problem Solving II  
* IGME-110 Introduction to Interactive Media 
* MATH-131 Discrete Mathematics

## Course Organization

Every day we'll have a warm-up exercise, some lecture/slides, and an exercise and/or quiz. There will be three mini-projects and a final project, along with two exams. Details below:



### Attendance : 15%

Attendance to each class is worth 2 points, weighted to 0.5% of your final grade. 30 classes adds up to 15%. 

> * 2 - show up: easy 0.5% 
> * 1 - notify me of an absence before class starts: consolation 0.25%
> * 0 - no communication: 0.0%

In the event that I cancel class, I will provide ample notice, and you'll receive full attendence credit for that class.



### Exercises : 15%

Each week we'll have an exercise. Each exercise is worth 2 points, weighted to 1% of your final grade. 15 exercises adds up to 15%.

> * 2 - high effort, complete: full 1.0% 
> * 1 - low effort, incomplete: partial 0.5%
> * 0 - fail to turn it in: 0.0%



### Quizzes : 10%

Most weeks we'll have a quiz (I have 11 planned). Each quiz is worth a varying amount of points, but each one is weighted to 0.909% of your final grade (yeah, the math is strange). Quizzes will be given through myCourses, and (usually) graded automatically. They are open book / open notes / open internet - closed communication. Quizzes have no time limit, but there will be a deadline.



### Projects : 40%

Over the semester we'll have three mini-projects that put together the pieces we've learned in class. The course culminates in one final project where you show off what you've learned. Each project is weighted to 10% of your final grade.

> * P1 - Random Placement
> * P2 - Asteroids
> * P3 - Humans v Zombies
> * FP - TBD (based on where the class ends up)



### Exams : 20%

Two exams: one mid-term, one final. Each exam is administered through myCourses, and weighted to 10% of your final grade. A portion of each is graded automatically, but the free-response answers require my eyes (so don't panic if you see a low mark at first!).
