## Quiz

[Incoming Survey](https://mycourses.rit.edu/d2l/lms/quizzing/quizzing.d2l?ou=663987&qi=761338) - This quiz does not count towards your final grade. It has two purposes:

1. Allows you to get familiar with the way myCourses does quizzes.
1. Allows me to be more familiar with your personal level of experience, and the general level of experience of the class as a whole. (Which helps me make the class better for you!)
