# Class 10-2

## Agenda

1. [Warm-Up Exercise](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k4bU2ukVHBcgT1sr2Sd1st5lq9W1dARgtzrwAIe-PjA)
1. [Lecture Code](https://github.com/IGME-202-17F6/lecture-code-basic-steer) - [Summary : Debug Lines](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CStDW2qC2Wa-eczsIRitdAap5LzU3Gx5c2PeW_HUQKk)

## Exercise

Instead of an exercise, work on your projects. I'll be checking progress on Tuesday, expecting you to be the first part of the suggested timeline, and will use that check as an Exercise grade.

## Readings

No readings this weekend. Remember to consult Nature of Code and/or Reynolds' when having trouble with your steering behaviors!

Here's another set of resources on steering behaviors [envato tuts+](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/series/understanding-steering-behaviors--gamedev-12732).

## Quiz

Complete this quiz by 5pm before our next meeting.
