## Exercise

No exercise. Instead I'll be doing another Project 3 check-in that counts as an Exercise grade on Tuesday. You should be mostly done with milestone 2 (roughly, you're welcome to pick and choose from the other milestones as you see fit).


## Readings

No readings, work on Project 3!

## Quiz

No quiz this week. We'll have one next week!
