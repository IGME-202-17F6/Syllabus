## Exercise

[Forces of Attraction](https://classroom.github.com/a/MEHCYtow) - Using the ideas from today's Lecture Code, complete the exercise according to its Readme.md file. I'd like this to be done by Thursday, but I'm giving you until Tuesday so you can ask questions!

## Readings

Read this article ahead of our next class:

1. [Nature of Code : 6 - Autonomous Agents](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/) - We'll be reading the whole chapter eventually, but for now you can stop at the end of 6.3 (don't read 6.4 Arriving Behavior, unless you'd like to go on ahead...).

## Quiz

Complete this quiz by 5pm before our 10-1 meeting.
