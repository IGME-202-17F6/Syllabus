## Exercise

None! Finish your project!

## Readings

Enjoy your break!

If you're looking for something (completely unrelated to class) to read:
* [Three Worlds Collide](http://robinhanson.typepad.com/files/three-worlds-collide.pdf) (I have another suggestion from the same author, but it takes longer than a weekend to read and eats your life, so I'm going to wait until the end of the semester to point you at it.)

## Quiz

Complete this quiz by 5pm before you leave for break. (Deadline 11:59pm on Tuesday, 11/21)
[Quiz 9: More Steering Forces](https://mycourses.rit.edu/d2l/lms/quizzing/quizzing.d2l?ou=663987&qi=761295)
